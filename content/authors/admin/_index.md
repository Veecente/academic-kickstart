My name is Michael Vicente and I'm currently a student at Stony Brook University. During my time here I have chosen to study Computer Science and Applied Mathematics & Statistics. Since a young age I've had a fascination with numbers, from rudimentary equations to complex systems I love how they can be arranged to solve the worlds deepest problems. This passion to solve problems has lead me down the path of Computer Science. Like everyone else, I started by learning basic programs but have since diverged into more complex problems.

I currently am interested in AI/ML. I also have a strong passion for teaching which is why I tutor at a mathematics learning center in my free time on the weekends. As far as other hobbies I enjoy finance and particularly the stock market. I enjoy learning about how a system as large as the stock market can be swayed by an array of variables and is something which many people try to predict, but only few succeed. This is why I aim to research new tech and work to further understand how we can better understand the world around us
